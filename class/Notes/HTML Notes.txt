HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language. 
GML  ---> SGML   ---> HTML .
current version is HTML5
Html consists of tag. there are two representation of tags
<opentag>  , </closetag>
html code will be between <html> and </html>
html consists head and body
head is used for meta data and body is used for actual website

To get basic template we can use emmets --> !+enter or html:5+enter

To comment something in HTML, 
<!-- comment -->

first code:
<!--  This is my first HTML file  -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- this line means following document is a html document -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- this is html open tag with an attribute lang with value en -->
<head><!-- head starts -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"><!-- charcter set - unicode transmission format -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- viewport setting-->
    <title>Document</title><!-- title will come on top (tab section)-->
</head><!-- head is closed -->
<body><!-- body open tag -->
   hello world 
</body><!-- body close tag -->
</html><!-- html close tag -->
=======================================
Elements: elements are nothing but complete tag with its content i.e., open tag+content+close tag
for eg:
<h1>
   hello
</h1>
Note: all elements needs not to be closed. some elements don't have any closing tag. they are called void elements or empty elements or self closing elements
eg: <img src="" alt="" />,<br />,<hr />

we can group the elements and make the groups as block or inline for styling
  -- general grouping block element - div
  -- general grouping inline element - span
============================================
Formatting Tags are used to format the texts such as making the text as bold,italic,highlight etc.., formatting tags are inline elements mostly

1. b -- used to make text bold
2. strong -- also used to make text bold but having higher impact to SEO since search engine understand b and strong differntly
3. i -- used to make text italic
4. em --also used to make text italic but having higher impact to SEO since search engine understand i and em differntly
5. u -- used to make text underlined
6. mark -- used to highlight the text
7. del -- used to strike out a word/senetence but in perspective of search engine, it's deleted
8. ins -- used to insert certain value in the place of del
9. sub -- used to make value subscript
10. sup -- used to make value superscript
11. hr -- used to get horizontal line, 
12. br -- used to break the lines
13. pre -- used to make text appears as it is.
14. code -- used to write any codes
13. address -- used to assign the address.
=========================================
Tables are used to represent the data in rows and columns.
table uses 'table' tag
a table contains table row as 'tr' tag
A tr may contain th(table head) or td(table data)
th -- table head will be automatically middle and bold
td- raw table data
we can also use caption to put table a caption

To combine rows, we can use rowspan attribute 
To combine column, we can use colspan attribute
=========================================
lists are used to list of certain items.
  eg: dropdown list, shopping list, kirana,voter,menu,order,students, expenses, employee, markslist, , contact list, attendance, course

  Lists in HTML are three types
  1. ordered List:
  items in this lists are of specific order. it has a tag ol and each list item will be li. default type is numbers
  <ol>
    <li>raj</li>
    <li>raman</li>
    <li>rani</li>
  </ol>
  we can also give types of a, A, i, I for different orders

  2. Unordered List: items in this list are of no order ,by default represented by bullet points. 
  <ul>
     <li>raj</li>
    <li>raman</li>
    <li>rani</li>
  </ul> 
  we can also give types such as circle,rectangle,none

  one list can be inserted inside another link known as nested lists

  3. Definition lists: Definition lists are used to define certain words,events,historical milestones
  it is represented by 'dl' tag ,it also have dt(definition term) and dd(definition data).
=========================================
semantic elements are introduced in HTML by HTML5. These block elements does not create any impact to UI but using them search engine can understand your code effectively

Eg: header, footer,main,nav,aside,section,article

classes and ID: To identify an element , we can define an attribute class or id.  multiple elements may have same class name or for one elements, we can assign mutiple class names
=========================================
Forms are used to input the user's data/collect responses/login/signup etc..,
form will be embraced by form tag with attributes such as 
  -- action: path to which file form data to be submitted
Form contains multiple inputs
  input tag is used to collect inputs and it have following attributes
    -- type -- contains type of the input
    -- placeholder -- contains some dummy text to appear in input until user enters value. it helps user to find what to enter
    --value -- we can also predefine some value using value attribute
    -- name -- it contains the variable by which we submit input data
    -- id -- used to identify the input uniquely

instead of placeholder , we can use labels, label tag is used to make user identify what to enter and it can also connects with input by having input's id value in label's for.

Different Types of inputs:
we can use multiple types of inputs such as
  -- text -- used for alphanumerical values
  -- email -- used for email addresses
  -- password -- used for secret info,
  -- file -- used for uploading a file
  -- button -- used to create a button
  -- submit -- used to create a button that can submit the form

  -- hidden -- used to make the textbox which can be submitted but hidden
  -- color  -- used to select a particular color

<!-- create a simple login form with labels and name attribute  -->
========================================
Radio Buttons: we will use radio buttons when we have to take any one single choice
we can insert them using input type 'radio', every radio button must have name and label connected
All radio buttons of similar use must have same have
 <input type="radio" name="gender" id="m">
     <label for="m">Male</label>
     <input type="radio" name="gender" id="f">
     <label for="f">Female</label>
Check boxes: we can use check boxes by input type 'check' and we use them when we need to select multiple options
labels should be connected and all checks of similar cause must have same name
 <input type="checkbox" name="lang" id="en">
       <label for="en">English</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="lang" id="hi">
       <label for="hi">Hindi</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="lang" id="te">
       <label for="te">Telugu</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="lang" id="mt">
       <label for="mt">Marathi</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="lang" id="kr">
       <label for="kr">Korean</label>
we can insert dropdown using select element and each option will have option tag with 'value' attribute
if we have to select multiple we need to add multiple at the end of attributes of select

we can group option using optgroup with label
 <select name="branch" size="8" id="" multiple>
            <optgroup label="ENGG">
               <option value="EEE">EEE</option>
            <option value="cse">CSE</option>
            <option value="ece">ECE</option>

            </optgroup>
            <optgroup label="Degree">
             <option value="bsc">BSC</option>
              <option value="">BCA</option>
              <option value="">BCOM</option>
